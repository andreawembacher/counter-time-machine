<h1> Time machine </h1>
<p> The counter-time-machine app is a simple counter implemented to modify the current year showed in the date box.</p>

<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>The counter can be incremented and decremented by clicking on the plus and minus buttons. Once the user have decided how many years they wanto go forward or backward in time, the sum is added to the date box by clicking on the START button. After START is clicked, the plus and minus buttons are blocked. Then the user can only click the RESET button to go back to count value zero and the current year. In this way all the functions are restored. </p>
