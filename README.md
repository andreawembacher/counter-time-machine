<h1> Time machine </h1>
<p> The counter-time-machine app is a simple counter implemented to modify the current year showed in the date box.</p>

<h2>About the project</h2>
<p>The counter can be incremented and decremented by clicking on the plus and minus buttons. Once the user have decided how many years go forward or backward in time, the sum is added or subtracted to the current year in the date box by clicking on the START button. After it has been clicked, the plus and minus buttons are blocked and the user can only reset the count value to 0 and the date to the current year by clicking on the RESET button. In this way all the functions are restored. </p>
